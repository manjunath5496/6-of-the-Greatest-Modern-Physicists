<p>Hawking was born in&nbsp;<a title="Oxford" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford">Oxford</a>&nbsp;into a family of doctors. Hawking began his university education at&nbsp;<a title="University College, Oxford" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College,_Oxford">University College, Oxford</a>&nbsp;in October 1959 at the age of 17, where he received a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="First Class Honours" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Class_Honours#First-class_honours">first-class</a>&nbsp;<a title="Honours degree" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_degree">BA (Hons.) degree</a>&nbsp;in physics. He began his graduate work at&nbsp;<a title="Trinity Hall, Cambridge" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Hall,_Cambridge">Trinity Hall, Cambridge</a>&nbsp;in October 1962, where he obtained his&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="PhD" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhD">PhD</a>&nbsp;degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology in March 1966.</p>
<p>In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Motor neurone disease" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neurone_disease">motor neurone disease</a>&nbsp;(also known as&nbsp;<a title="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a>&nbsp;(ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades.&nbsp;After the loss of his speech, he was able to communicate through a&nbsp;<a title="Speech-generating device" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech-generating_device">speech-generating device</a>&mdash;initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.</p>
<p>Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with&nbsp;<a title="Roger Penrose" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose">Roger Penrose</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a title="Penrose&ndash;Hawking singularity theorems" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose%E2%80%93Hawking_singularity_theorems">gravitational singularity theorems</a>&nbsp;in the framework of&nbsp;<a title="General relativity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">general relativity</a>&nbsp;and the theoretical prediction that&nbsp;<a title="Black hole" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black holes</a>&nbsp;emit radiation, often called&nbsp;<a title="Hawking radiation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation">Hawking radiation</a>. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="General theory of relativity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_theory_of_relativity">general theory of relativity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Quantum mechanics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. He was a vigorous supporter of the&nbsp;<a title="Many-worlds interpretation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">many-worlds interpretation</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Quantum mechanics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of&nbsp;<a title="Popular science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_science">popular science</a>&nbsp;in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book&nbsp;<em><a title="A Brief History of Time" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time">A Brief History of Time</a></em>&nbsp;appeared on the&nbsp;<em><a title="The Sunday Times" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times">Sunday Times</a></em>&nbsp;bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a&nbsp;<a title="Fellow of the Royal Society" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society">Fellow of the Royal Society</a>, a lifetime member of the&nbsp;<a title="Pontifical Academy of Sciences" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Academy_of_Sciences">Pontifical Academy of Sciences</a>, and a recipient of the&nbsp;<a title="Presidential Medal of Freedom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the&nbsp;<a title="BBC" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a>'s poll of the&nbsp;<a title="100 Greatest Britons" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Greatest_Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a>. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.</p>
